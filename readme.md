# Adult Income Prediction using Machine Learning Pipeline

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning pipeline to predict income levels based on the Adult Income Census dataset. The pipeline includes various components such as a custom logging system, custom exception handling and deliverables ensuring robust and transparent operation throughout the ML workflow.





## Dataset

Becker, B. & Kohavi, R. (1996). Adult [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20.


## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and loading the dataset for processing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to identify patterns, distributions, and correlations.
- **Data Transformation**: Preprocessing and transforming the data for model readiness.
- **Model Training**: Training various models to predict income levels.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the model to a Flask server for making predictions on new data.
- **Logger and Exception Handler**: Custom logging and exception handling mechanisms are integrated to provide transparency, easy debugging, and robust error management across the pipeline.
- **Artifacts/Deliverables**: All key artifacts such as preprocessed data transformations, trained models, and important EDA insights are saved and versioned in the artifacts/ directory for reproducibility and further analysis.
The project demonstrates end-to-end model development and deployment while leveraging custom logging and error handling for a production-ready solution.
